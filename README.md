This is a project that aims to scrape data of all movie screenings that happened in BITS Hyderabad, and consolidating this data cleanly in a spreadsheet.

## Background
I was the Joint Secretary of Movie Club BPHC, and this has always been something we have wanted to track: all the films even screened on campus. And we know that almost all of this data exists on two Facebook groups, BPHC Shoutbox and BPHC Free Expression Group.

We have previously tried making juniors (slaves) manually go through old posts and update a common sheet, but this hasn't been a reliable way of getting this data, especially because the juniors don't find it very enjoyable to go through hundreds of posts and fill sheets with no reward in return.

But with a cunnning combination of web scraping techniques and leveraging LLMs, we can finally try to get this data without any slave labour whatsoever.
